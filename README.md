# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview

Using machine learning and neural networks, we’ll use the features in the provided dataset to help create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The Alphabet Soup Charity dataset contains more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as the following:

- EIN and NAME—Identification columns
- APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type
- AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry
- CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification
- USE_CASE—Use case for funding
- ORGANIZATION—Organization type
- STATUS—Active status
- INCOME_AMT—Income classification
- SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special consideration for application
- ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested
- IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively

Then, using TensorFlow, you’ll design a neural network, or deep learning model, to create a binary classification model that can predict if an Alphabet Soup–funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset. After which I'll compile, train, and evaluate your binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy. While using TensorFlow, optimize your model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%. If you can't achieve an accuracy higher than 75%.

## Summary 
Unfortunately, the optimization tool yielded only a 52.4% accuracy. I would continue to use other algorithms and models to reach the target of 75% accuracy rate. I would restrategize a building model, use Boolean metrics of successful outcomes, bucketing, and informing the Random Forest Decision Tree Model for a possible higher accuracy rate. ![Accuracy rate](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98790082/179442806-d2d40ca6-66a6-4343-a335-3fe7a00d4cfb.png)
